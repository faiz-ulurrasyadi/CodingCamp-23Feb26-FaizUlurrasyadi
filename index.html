                    <h3>Quadruped Robot</h3>
                    <p hidden>This four-legged (quadruped) robot is my first big project. The robot is quite big with length, width and height are 590 x 413 x 377 mm, respectively. I use eight DC motors 24V as actuator with each leg has two motors. I use potentiometer as position sensor and write custom control program with PID control. With Arduino Mega as main controller, I was able to make this robot move (get up from sitting position and trot gait walk) using simple inverse kinematics of 2 DoF for trajectory planning.</p>

                    <h3>Humanoid Robot</h3>
                    <p hidden>This is my main project when I was working under my professor’s laboratory back in 2021. I designed this compact kid-size humanoiod robot using Autodesk Inventor, starting from mechanical design until how all the electrical components are placed. This humanoid robot has height and weight of 85 cm and 9 kg, respectively, uses PLA and PETG 3D print as its main material. It has 30 degrees of freedom to support its movement using Dynamixel Servos. This humanoid robot was using Jetson Nano as its main controller with ubuntu and ROS 1 for operating system and framework. I use inverse kinematics with pseudoinverse method and orthogonal rotational matrix for motion planning. Here is the video of <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/UGow9568UP4" target="_blank">my humanoid robot walking</a>. </p>

                    <h3>Simulation of humanoid robot learning to walk</h3>
                    <p hidden>Still related to humanoid robot, but instead of get in touch with real robot, this time it is done in virtual world. By using CoppeliaSim, I was able to train a simple humanoid robot to walk. I use primitive shape (cube, sphere, cylinder) for humanoid robot model to reduce the computanional cost. In the beginning, the agent or humanoid robot doesn’t know exactly how to walk properly, then by applying my algorithm of RuleBased Learning, the robot could walk further as it learns more. Here is the video of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPOuNfVgGlM" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600">agent or humanoid robot training</a> and here is the result <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDD0fsgNHXM" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600">after training</a>. I also did an update to learning parameter by adding the walking direction. This time the robot was able to walk in straight line.</p>

                    <h3>An attachment for AMR robot</h3>
                    <p hidden>This is an attachment for AMR robot to tow three trollies or carts in the warehouse. This attachment was made and built by mostly standard part we can find in a mechanical shop without needing any custom manufacturing plate, makes it cheap in term of cost. It has a feature to lock all three carts at the same time by pressing a trigger and release all at once by pressing another trigger. This attachment was able to tow for a total of 1000 kg of load (tested). I also did an upgrade for this attachment by adding a mechanism to automatically lock or hooked when the cart was pushed to this attachment and also adding the release trigger to be controlled by an actuator like motor.</p>

                    <h3>Arm Robot</h3>
                    <p hidden>This project needs me to do re-engineering an AMR robot, then modifying its internal structure such as changing the motor, gear ratio, adding some new electronical parts, design a new bumper structure, etc. All these changing sometimes will make an old mechanical structure doesn’t compatible anymore. That's where my job as a designer comes in, to design partial improvements by considering several things, such as the availability of parts in stores, the cost for improvements, the ease of maintenance, etc.</p>

                    <h3>Human following cart robot</h3>
                    <p hidden>This robot has the main purpose of carrying luggage at the airport, helping with food service in restaurants, and other things that do not require a heavy load. It uses Raspberry Pi 5 as mini pc, a camera to detect a human, and also a lidar for obstacle detector. In this robot, the newest ROS 2 is used to integrate all sensors, actuators and control system. There are three modes in this robot, idle, manual, and human following. Idle means the robot will stop or do nothing, manual means we can control the robot using a remote control, human following means the robot will follow a detected human in front of it. The robot also has feature to stop immediately when a person or object suddenly detected in human following mode. This function added as a replacement of a bumper sensor, for safety. You can see the demonstration of this robot by clicking this <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/WY8llvDKBrA?si=BGpYkhXL9I82EQqG" class="text-blue-600" target="_blank">link</a>. I also had the chance to teach high schoolers on how to build this robot.</p>
